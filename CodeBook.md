The data set is available from <a href="https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones"> here </a>.

None of the variable names have been changed from the original set, and other than sub-setting, and merging, the only data manipulation was to calculate the mean of all variable means & standard deviations, grouped by Activity and Subject ID.


All steps are described in the ReadMe file.
